#### Data Used
The raw data has been obtained from a research paper 'Association Rule Mining in Discovering Travel Pattern in Passport Data Analysis' by Rani et al from International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology. Before proceeding with Association Rule Mining (using APRIORI Algorithm) in R, the obtained data must be converted into ‘transaction data’ where all the entries of each variable are converted into a single row (or multiple columns).
