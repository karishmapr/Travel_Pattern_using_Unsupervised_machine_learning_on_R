## Association Rule Mining (Apriori)

#### Summary
The current study presents the association between the most chosen destination among Indian travellers based on their profession and visa entitlement using APRIORI algorithm. For the current study Association Rule Mining was implemented in to two software R 3.6.1 and SAS Enterprise Miner 14.3 with minimum 5% support and 80% confidence. The dominant destinations corresponding to the profession and visa type was obtained. It was found that most of the individuals who are travelling to UAE are labour by profession with labour visa. Indian travellers who are students prefer the UK as their education destination whilst IT workers are likely to go to the USA on IT work visa. Ireland is famous among bankers who travel on business visa whilst France is famous tourist destination among travellers working in Defence Services.

#### < a href = https://github.com/karishmapr/travel_pattern_unsupervised_machine_learning/blob/master/Travel_Pattern_R.xlsx> Data Used </a>
The raw data has been obtained from a research paper 'Association Rule Mining in Discovering Travel Pattern in Passport Data Analysis' by Rani et al from International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology. Before proceeding with Association Rule Mining (using APRIORI Algorithm) in R, the obtained data is converted into ‘transaction data’ where all the entries of each variable are converted into a single row (or multiple columns). 

#### Tools used
R is used for the current exercise.
